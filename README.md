### About Me
- I am a third year Computer Science Major at the University of Toronto Mississauga
- My current favourite course is Software Tools and Systems, and my favourite assignment from within this course involved setting up a replica of the bash shell. 
- In my free time, I like to read, write, play minecraft, go on long walks and skateboard!
- I am currently working on a productivity extension of Google Calendar, wherein a user can log the amount of time they spend working on something (categorized based off of their calendars). You can find it [here](https://github.com/zoyasiddiqui/Calendar-Productivity-Tracker.git).

### Past, Present, and Future
**In high school**, I was torn in two different directions: Computer Science and the Arts. I love to be creative and I really enjoyed coding. Right up until I accepted my offer to UTM, I was worried about possibly being unhappy in Computer Science. However, as soon as I came into the program, I was sure about my decision. I have come to find that creativity can take many forms, and the ability to take an idea and turn it into a functioning project is priceless. 

**Currently, in university**, I am working on learning as much as I possibly can. Though I have yet to pick a specific field, I find many concepts in Computer Science to be extremely fascinating. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my math courses up to this point, and also loved taking *Data Structures and Algorithms*, despite its difficulty. So far, my favourite courses have been *Introduction to Software Design* and *Software Tools and Systems*, and learning Java and C has opened me up to the many, many possible projects I can make. 

**After university**, I hope to pursue a technical field that I am really passionate about. Currently, I am still working on discovering which field may be best for me. I am fascinated by the world of AI and Machine Learning, but Information Security has also recently peaked my interest. At the moment, I am most interested in Computer Vision and Computer Animation.
