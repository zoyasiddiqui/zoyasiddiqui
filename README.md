### About Me
- Last April, I wrapped up my third year at UTM, doing a major in Computer Science. Currently, I am an intern at AMD on the Diagnostics Infrastructure and Automation CI team.
- Currently, I'm gaining hands on experience in continuous integration and automation, getting more comfortable working with and improving scalable systems, and improving my skills in collaborative engineering.
- I'm also working on my personal website. In my free time, I love designing pretty websites and hopefully some day being able to add cool animations to them.

### Past, Present, and Future
**In high school**, I was torn in two different directions: Computer Science and the Arts. I love to be creative and I really enjoyed coding. Right up until I accepted my offer to UTM, I was worried about possibly being unhappy in Computer Science. However, as soon as I came into the program, I was sure about my decision. I have come to find that creativity can take many forms, and the ability to take an idea and turn it into a functioning project is priceless. 

**Currently, in university**, I am working on learning as much as I possibly can. Though I have yet to pick a specific field, I find many concepts in Computer Science to be extremely fascinating. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my math courses up to this point, and also loved taking *Data Structures and Algorithms*, despite its difficulty. So far, my favourite courses have been *Introduction to Software Design* and *Software Tools and Systems*, and learning Java and C has opened me up to the many, many possible projects I can make. 

**After university**, I hope to pursue a technical field that I am really passionate about. Currently, I am still working on discovering which field may be best for me. I am fascinated by the world of AI and Machine Learning, but Information Security has also recently peaked my interest. At the moment, I am most interested in Computer Vision and Computer Animation.
